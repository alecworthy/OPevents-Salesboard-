📊 Sales Dashboard & Reporting (Google Sheets)
📌 Project Overview

This project focused on building and designing a sales dashboard in Google Sheets to support performance tracking, reporting, and decision-making for a sales team.
The goal was to transform raw sales data into a clear, automated reporting solution, using data cleaning, pivot tables, and structured metrics to provide visibility across revenue, targets, and trends.
The final output was a salesboard that stakeholders could easily interact with, update, and use on an ongoing basis.

🎯 Objectives

- Clean and standardise raw sales data for analysis
- Design a scalable reporting structure in Google Sheets
- Build pivot tables to summarise performance metrics
- Create a clear, user-friendly sales dashboard
- Enable non-technical stakeholders to track KPIs easily
